The Center for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) develops collaborative research on issues related to social conflict and cohesion (coexistence) in Chile, through a multidisciplinary team from the social sciences and humanities.

COES focuses its academic and dissemination activities on the analysis of the multiple manifestations of social conflict in Chile, its causes and its cultural and historical context.

The Centre is sponsored by the Universidad de Chile and the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and its partner institutions are the Universidad Diego Portales and the Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez. COES is funded by ANID’s FONDAP programme.

This data repository contains the data files and other documents associated with the leading research projects developed by COES. First, the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC) is available here, a panel survey that analyzes attitudes and behaviors on topics of sociability, inequality, and conflict as its temporal trajectories for a sample of Chileans. Secondly, the Observatory of Conflicts (OC) collects information on the occurrence of social conflicts and contentious actions in Chile derived from media content analysis, to characterize the levels of conflictiveness during recent decades. A third project available here is the Observatory of Labor Strikes (OHL), which focuses on documenting the occurrence of labor strikes (legal and illegal), to study in-depth the labor conflict in contemporary Chile. To achieve this objective, OHL has carried out a systematic registry of strikes in the country since 2010, complementing the registry prepared by Alberto Armstrong for the period 1979-2010. Finally, the Survey of Conflict and Social Cohesion 2014 (ENCOES 2014) is a cross-sectional study on the main dimensions of conflict and social harmony with a design that facilitates multilevel and spatial analysis.

Within this site, you can access the data repositories associated with each of these projects. Inside of these, you will be able to access and download the data sets, methodological documents, and results reports.
